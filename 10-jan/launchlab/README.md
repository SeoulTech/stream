Sunghyun Cho

Sunghyun Cho ºs performative installations have their origin in the perceptive experience of nature, somewhat resembling the early experiences of an infant exploring his or her surroundings. The recurring themes of his works examine the notions of communication, forms generated from the dynamics of nature, and the relationship between space and sound.
