# LaunchLab

Responsible: @kolyaak

Draft on meetup: http://www.meetup.com/seoul-tech-society/events/219170649/

## What is Launch Lab?
As part of Stream - knowledge implementation program, SeoulTech is proud to announce the Launch Lab kick off event. Scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, designers, and any tech enthusiast interested in real innovation discuss and propose (any) project, and solicit ideas and help from other SeoulTech members.

They present early-stage ideas to get feedback from the audience and recruit new members to further develop their ideas during six months Stream program. There will be six presentations total, but this is not a competition. The goal is to share ideas and to learn from each other.

## Why?
This program allow members  to get involved with the creation of new ideas or startups, while forging friendships and business partnerships to last a lifetime. 

We are very excited about technology and its potential in the near future, and we want to focus our energy into developing projects that have real-life consequences. We hope to help people start projects that can solve relevant issues in Infrastructure, Security, Energy, the Environment, and other areas that have actual consequences. The projects do not necessarily have to take the form of venture-funded startups. We also hope to attract open-source projects, non-profits, or other forms that do not necessarily fit into some predetermined pigeon hole. Of course, we will also help teams develop relationships with investors if a project has potential as a high-growth startup.

##How? 
Apply in RSVP. We will pre-select 6 ideas for the presentation (10 to 15 minute), and if anyone gets inspired meanwhile we will have an open mic for more ideas from any attendee. If you don’t get selected, don’t worry. There will be plenty of time for you to network with others and get feedback during the session. Remember, this is about creating a community, not about competition.

If you have an idea but don’t want to present, bring it with you anyways. There will be plenty of time for you to discuss and share with others.

If you are curious about joining a team or just want to listen and learn, then please come along. We will do our best to make sure everybody gets a chance to participate
