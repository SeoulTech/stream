## Official description
What is LaunchLab?
As part of knowledge transfer series(xxx.seoultechsociety.org), SeoulTech with MIT REAP Korea partnership is proud to announce the LaunchLab kick off event.  Researchers, entrepreneurs and innovators discuss and propose (any) project, and solicit ideas and help from other SeoulTech members. They can further apply to participate in the program of knowledge transfer series.

Why?
LaunchLab helps members take one giant leap beyond networking. These events allow members to get involved with the creation of new ideas or startups, while forging friendships and business partnerships to last a lifetime. 

How? 
The event features a group of speakers that give a 10 to 15 minute presentation of their idea. The audience then discusses the idea. Audience members can also choose to join or further contribute to the project.

Open discussion sessions will also be available, so if anyone gets inspired they can share and discuss their ideas with the group.

When?
TBD

14:00 - 18:00: Presentations + Discussion + Coffee/Beer/Snacks

18:00 - 20:00: Dinner 

Call for projects and proposals!
If you are a researcher, startup founder, entrepreneur, idea generator, or dreamer, sign up to be a speaker!

Note: This event is part of knowledge transfer series. For more information about the program, please refer to the web-page xxx.seoultechsociety.org
