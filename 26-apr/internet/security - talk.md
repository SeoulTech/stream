letter to Paul

Hi, Paul

Hope, you are well.

I would like to ask you for a help (hope, it will not be a big burden).  
I'm preparing a talk for our next event on **Sunday** about the Internet and Innovation from the STREAM series [http://www.streamprogram.co](http://www.streamprogram.co) (I mentioned you about STREAM earlier). I should cover the security part (you know my research interest in it, we've just submitted a paper with Joshua about cyber peacekeeping).  
I want to give Palantir as an example of an innovation-driven company in this area. In the about page I saw "a core engineering commitment" and "open software" believes. But may be you can give me some hints how to describe your approach to innovation better? 
In addition I wonder whether(how) Palantir collaborates with universities for long-term research? What is your collaboration with smaller companies (startups)?  
Would you recommend me other companies/researches to look at in the area of the Internet security?

Sincerely,
Nikolay
